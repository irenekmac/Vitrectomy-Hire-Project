# Vitrectomy Hire Service Web App

This project is based off a proposed solution to a real life problem that my previous workplace faced.

Solution being to automate the sales process for better accessibility to clients. Minimising human error in gathering client details and making the sales process, faster and more efficient.

## Deployment

I used heroku to deploy: [Vitrectomy Website](https://rails-heroku-vitrectomyhire.herokuapp.com/)

### Things to edit:
* Psuedo code
* CSS for styling

## Things to add in the future:

* integrate with CRM system
* notify technicians of clients who make a request - automate if client.state == technician.state
